## General Information
- lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). 
- In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
- If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.
- Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 


## Conclusions
-  Charged off proportion increases with increase in interest rates. Interest rate more than 16% has very high chances of charged off.
- Proportion of charged off applicants increases with grade moving from A towards F
-  "Small Business" applicants have high chances of getting charged off. "Renewable energy" and "educational applicants" are next categories where charge off is high.
- Employment length of less than one year has highest proportion of
charged off loan applicants. 
- Charge off applicants numbers are significantly higher in case of 60 months loan.
- With increase in annual income charged off proportion decreases. Income range (0-20000) has high chances of charged off.
